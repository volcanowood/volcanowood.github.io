Edison Coffee Storefront Design
Completed in September 2020
Edison Coffee's store is a special old bungalow. Considering the personality traits of the owner and the business requirements (through aesthetic and objective needs surveys), the final work presents the following features:
Distinctive Sliding Gates: These gates add a unique touch to the storefront.
Gradient - textured Illuminated Signboard: It not only makes the store stand out but also gives a sense of modernity.
Exclusive Wall Treatment: (When designing Gather Coffee, we experimented and solved the control problem of similar materials. We believe that in future applicable space designs, we can create more wonderful expressions with such materials.)
Square - shaped Interior Space with Open - scale and Clear - cut Zoning: This layout provides customers with a comfortable and spacious environment.
Ceiling Openings for Natural Light: It allows natural light to flood in, creating a pleasant atmosphere.
Some of these features were truly unique in Chengdu for quite a while after the completion of the project. However, being "exclusive" is never the real selling point. The harmonious combination of aesthetics and commerce is the core. We believe that many of these features will attract imitations. But a 耐看的作品，not just a superficial imitation of the appearance can achieve. It requires a deep understanding of design concepts and the ability to balance various elements. 

Edison coffee 咖啡 店面设计
2020年9月完工
Edison咖啡因为店面特殊且老平房。
结合主理人的个性特征和经营需求。
（审美调查和客观需求调查）
最后呈现作品中
◻️特质推拉大门
◻️渐变质感的发光门头
◻️独家的墙面处理
（在gather咖啡设计时我们做了实验解决了类似材料的控制问题 相信以后遇到适用的空间设计还会把类似材料做出更多精彩表达）
◻️方正的内部空间 开阔的尺度和分区
◻️可以引入天光的顶面开口
以上特点其中一部分在完工后的相当一段时间
绝对是成都独步的。
但“独家”永远不是真正的买点，审美和商业的融洽才是核心。
相信其中很多特色 后面会引来模仿🔔
耐看的作品，不是表面样式的粗浅模仿就可以的。
