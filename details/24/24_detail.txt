Coffee Shop Design: A Grateful Note for FIOSIG's Repeated Selection
Thanks to FIOSIG for choosing us again.
FIOSIG, a brand we've worked with, gave us two projects: the reopening of its old store two years ago and the design of its second store this year. It's been two years between these two projects, yet they still chose us.
This time, for FIOSIG, Volcanic Konan Design didn't just design new stores. We also redesigned its brand - related visual elements, such as the logo, packaging, fonts, and other peripheral visuals.
The owner's dedication to product quality, combined with our continuous design support, equals a lasting good reputation.
