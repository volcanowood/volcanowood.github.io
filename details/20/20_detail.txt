Fika Commercial Space Design in Guiyang - A Coffee Shop Project
Completed in October 2022
"Fika" represents a type of coffee break and a unique Swedish lifestyle. It's a state of briefly stepping away from the current stress and relaxing oneself.
Our client, Ms. He Yibo (addressed as @He Yibo), hopes to convey this attitude to every guest who visits the place.
Incorporating some elements of Scandinavian style into the space is what we both expected. In Guiyang, unlike in Northern Europe, we can boldly install floor - to - ceiling windows without worrying about the cold northern winds.
We would like to express our gratitude to the client for her trust and cooperation, which enabled us to complete another satisfying project.
Fika 商业空间设计 贵阳 coffee

“Fika” 茶歇的一种，瑞典特别的一种生活态度，是一种短暂跳出当下的紧绷，放松自己的状态 。
我们的委托人@何一波是何小姐 希望把这种态度，呈现给每一个来到这里的伙伴。
在空间中融入斯堪的纳维亚的一些气息 是我们共同期望的，不过在贵阳我们可以大胆的把窗户做到落地而不去担心北欧的冷风。
感谢委托人的信任和配合 ，让我们又完成了一个满意的作品。
