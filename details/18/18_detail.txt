Yifang Coffee Shop Renovation
We reorganized the space, aiming to enhance the spatial experience and functionality with minimal alterations.
We also reworked the visual system. We redetermined the brand colors, brand fonts, as well as the application principles of the VI (Visual Identity) and its peripheral supports.
This project is neither flashy nor stunning. However, it has received favorable comments from the shop owner and regular customers who visited before the renovation. That's enough.
