The 2.0 Version of Gray Elephant Coffee Opens - Coffee Shop Design
The spatial plan is a joint creation of the client and the designer. Design isn't merely about the "drawing - only theory" like "How much do you charge for the design drawings?"
Just like this project, it can indeed be regarded as the 2.0 version of the Gray Elephant Coffee's image. Niu'er, the owner, said, "The Gray Elephant 1.0 store was managed and decorated by myself." The young lady enjoys doing things by herself and has accumulated experience from design to construction through her first store.
However, as Niu'er put it, the more she experienced, the more she realized that professional help in design was needed to better integrate her aesthetic preferences, functional requirements, and limited budget with the space. During this process, she also kept sharing her records and experiences @Niu'er, Struggling to Open a Coffee Shop.
The client took care of the logo design on their own.

灰象咖啡2.0版 开业 咖啡店设计
空间方案 是客户+设计共同的作品。
设计不只是“请问出图多少钱”这样的“画图论”。
正如这个项目，确实算是是灰象咖啡形象的2.0版
主理人牛儿说“灰象1.0店是自己打理出来”
小姐姐很喜欢自己动手，也是属于通过自己的第一家店积累了设计到施工的“经验”.
但是如牛儿说越是这样越发觉得觉得在设计上还是需要更专业的助力，才能将自己的审美、功能需求、有限预算与空间结合好。 在这个过程中她也一直有着记录与体验的分享@艰难开咖啡厅的牛二
logo设计客户自理。
