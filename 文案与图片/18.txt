A coffee shop renovation
[The picture is the comparison between the new VI and the space transformation]
Project story
Once when a coffee just started
The client tried counseling.
Because there is no schedule regret to miss.
The process of using space exposes a lot of pain points. Clients are also more aware of the need for realignment that requires more professional design intervention.
So "2.0 (designed by Volcano Kinan) side" was put on the agenda. We rearrange the space,
Improve the spatial experience and functionality with minimal changes.

We re-organize the visual system brand color brand font and re-determine the application principle of vi and the surrounding supporting.
It's not flashy or amazing

The director spoke highly of the finished work. @ A cafe

Former patrons also praised the renovation.
That's enough.

If you are interested in this seemingly simple but clever work, you are welcome to have a look. # Commercial space design # Coffee shop design # coffee shop vi design # brand design

项目故事
曾经一方咖啡刚刚启动的时候
委托人有尝试咨询。
因为没有档期抱憾错过。
使用空间的过程中暴露很多痛点。委托人也更加感知到需要更专业设计介入的重新进行调整的必要性。
于是“2.0（由火山木南设计的）一方”提上日程。我们对空间重新梳理，
以最少的改动去提升空间体验和功能。

我们对视觉体系重新整理品牌色 品牌字体 重新确定vi的应用原则与周边配套。
这个作品 不浮夸不惊艳

主理人对完成作品很好评。@一方咖啡的小屋

之前的老主顾对改造也很好评。
这就够了。
