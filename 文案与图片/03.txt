1. The width of the store is 1.9 meters, the depth is 19 meters, and the height is 6 meters.
2. The special changes in the wall. After completing the experiment myself, I guided the masters on site to complete it. The space has a psychedelic feeling like an archaeological site and reveals the same feeling of coffee layering. It also allows the team to master new skills.
3. Decisively expose part of the original demolished wall. The rough wall with translucent panels and lights also creates a high-end packaging feeling.
4. The on-site color matching, lighting, and mirror application are very proud
