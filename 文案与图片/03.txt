The store has a width of 1.9 meters, a depth of 19 meters, and a height of 6 meters. Regarding the special changes to the wall, after I completed the experiment myself, I guided the on-site workers to finish it. The space gives off a psychedelic vibe similar to that of an archaeological site, and it also conveys the same sense of coffee layering. Meanwhile, it enables the team to acquire new skills. We decisively exposed part of the original demolished wall. The rough wall, combined with translucent panels and lighting, creates a high-end packaging effect. I'm really proud of the on-site color coordination, lighting design, and the application of mirrors.
