【For Time Coffee, Chengdu 2020】
Works in 2020
【For Time Coffee】
The exterior facade of the site couldn't be altered! And there was an obtrusive main gas pipe! Actually, I thought it could be incorporated in a really cool way if we made use of it.
The deliberately designed undulations inside bring an interesting spatial rhythm and a unique lingering experience. Design should make the best use of circumstances.
For Time Coffee, this cup of coffee is always served at the right time.

【为时咖啡 FOR TIME COFFEE】
现场外立面不可以动！
还有突兀的燃气总管！
其实吧我觉得利用下也可以结合到很酷。
内部刻意的起伏，带来有趣的空间节奏和停留体验。
设计需要因势利导。
为时咖啡，这一杯，为时正好。
品牌包装➕空间设计
