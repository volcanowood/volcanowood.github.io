ABOUT PERSPECTVE ESPRESSO Coffee Shop Design
Blue with a gray undertone is used as the accent color. Paired with warm lighting, it creates a relaxing space for people to linger. A small store that seems to transport you to... just came into being.
The store owner has great taste in selecting items, injecting vitality into the space.
