Edison coffee coffee store design
It will be completed in September 2020
Edison Coffee because the store is special and the old bungalow.
Combine the personality characteristics and management needs of the manager.
(Aesthetic survey and objective needs survey)
Finally presented in the work
◻️ Trait pushes and pulls doors
◻️ Luminous door head with gradual texture
◻️ Exclusive wall treatment
(In the design of gather Coffee, we have done experiments to solve the control problem of similar materials, and I believe that in the future, we will find more wonderful expressions of similar materials when we meet the applicable space design.)
◻️ Square interior Spaces open to scale and zoning
◻️ The top opening through which skylight can be introduced
Some of the above features a considerable period of time after completion
It is definitely unique in Chengdu.
But "exclusive" is never the real buy, aesthetic and commercial harmony is the core.
I believe many of these features will attract imitations 🔔
Durable works, not superficial imitation of the surface style can be.

————— Summer 2022 update ⬇️ 🔴🔴🔴
Chengdu weather on 40° a summary of some conditions.:
🔴 The old house should first check the power supply situation to avoid the problem of no three-phase power and inability to expand the capacity (there was no experience at that time and it was really thundered) (now the air conditioning is in normal use)
🔴 skylight has the advantage that artificial light can not be compared, which will be a little worried in hot summer. At that time, when we discussed the design here, we planned to use a certain power consumption to balance. Received feedback that the site was hot, at that time, it was mainly thought that the skylight caused the insufficient air conditioning problem. Therefore, on-site inspection records are arranged as follows:
[3:00 PM peak time of July 2022 🔥 Site inspection records that the air conditioner refrigeration is normal, the body feeling in the space can actually measure 28 ~ 29 degrees, the temperature of the air conditioner outlet 17.8 degrees, in this heat collapse, a. Summer + half-open door is not tight, resulting in the outflow of air conditioning, b. Part of the lamp slot is connected with the next door leakage hot air. (We gave the solution, the manager approved the implementation is waiting)
🔴 After checking the site, I still feel that the sunshine of the original plan is more fragrant, and the remediation focus has shifted to the hot air leakage and the door being ahalf in the old house and next door.
🔴 I planned to make another layer of aluminum foil foam for the air conditioner on the roof (202207 Check that the construction records and photos retained at that time are already available, and the air conditioner refrigeration is normal)
🟡 In summary, good design is empowering for business. It was also the result of trade-offs. Feedback practical problems we must have a summary and common face mentality. We are still proud of the opportunity to make such commercial space works, and the problems we encounter are internalized into our experience and become our reminders and checklists.

Edison coffee 咖啡 店面设计
2020年9月完工
Edison咖啡因为店面特殊且老平房。
结合主理人的个性特征和经营需求。
（审美调查和客观需求调查）
最后呈现作品中
◻️特质推拉大门
◻️渐变质感的发光门头
◻️独家的墙面处理
（在gather咖啡设计时我们做了实验解决了类似材料的控制问题 相信以后遇到适用的空间设计还会把类似材料做出更多精彩表达）
◻️方正的内部空间 开阔的尺度和分区
◻️可以引入天光的顶面开口
以上特点其中一部分在完工后的相当一段时间
绝对是成都独步的。
但“独家”永远不是真正的买点，审美和商业的融洽才是核心。
相信其中很多特色 后面会引来模仿🔔
耐看的作品，不是表面样式的粗浅模仿就可以的。

—————2022夏更新⬇️ 🔴🔴🔴
成都天气上40°了 一些情况总结。
：
🔴老房要先检查供电情况 ，避免没有三相电和无法扩容的问题（当时没有经验确实踩雷了）（现在空调正常使用）
🔴天窗有人造光无法比的优点，酷暑下会有些担忧，当时这里在设计讨论的时候我们就是打算用一定的耗电量去平衡。收到反馈说现场热，当时一度认为主要是是天窗导致空调不够用问题。所以安排了现场查验记录如下：
【2022年7月下午3点高峰🔥时间 现场检查记录 空调制冷正常，空间中体感尚可实际测量28～29度，冷气出风口温度17.8度，在这个热的崩溃的，a.夏天+半开着的大门没有关严导致空调冷气外流 ，b.灯槽口有部分和隔壁连通漏热风。（我们给出了解决方案，主理人认可执行等待中）】
🔴查现场后依然觉得还是原方案的阳光更香，而补救重点转移到老房和隔壁的漏热风和大门半开的问题。
🔴本打算屋顶的空调再做一层铝箔发泡棉（202207检查当时留存的施工记录照片已经有，空调制冷正常）
🟡总结 好的设计是对生意的赋能。也是当时取舍的结果。反馈实际问题我们要有总结和共同面对心态。（有机会做出这样的商业空间作品我们依然骄傲，遇到的问题也内化成我们的经验，成为了我们的提醒和检查清单。
