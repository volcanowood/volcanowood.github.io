Ningdu Coffee in Lhasa: Renovation of an Ancient Building
Lhasa | Ningdu Coffee | Xiazha Compound Branch
The "Xiazha Compound" is a cultural relic protection unit and the Lhasa Thangka Culture Center. Ningdu Coffee was invited to open a branch in the Xiazha Compound.
This branch provides coffee beverages with unique Lhasa characteristics for tourists. There was actually only one theme in the commission: the ancient building requires absolute protection! First, we carried out laser scanning and modeling to fully preserve the structure, then made safe renovations to the electrical and water circuits, and appropriately exposed the original structure. In this way, Ningdu Coffee was naturally integrated with the Xiazha Compound.
It's our great honor to participate in this project.

柠渡咖啡 拉萨 古建改造
拉萨｜柠渡咖啡｜ 夏扎大院店
“夏扎大院”文物保护单位 拉萨唐卡文化中心
“柠渡咖啡”受邀入驻，建立夏扎店。
为游客提供独具拉萨特色的咖啡饮品。

委托中其实只有一个主题：
老建筑需要绝对保护！我们先进行激光扫描建模充分保留结构，进行了安全的电路水路改造，并适当暴露原始结构。自然而然的让柠渡和夏扎大院融合。
很荣幸参与这个项目。
