Early fair coffee shop design coffee shop design
20210504 First fair coffee shop opened
A new space designed by Koyama Minami
In fact, I do not like to use style to limit the design
So I just want to say that this is suitable for the first fair space.
Space, color and lighting
It's all about showing this warm, intimate neighborhood store.
Often go to the first fair friends
You'll feel it when you get to the new store
The new store is the old store "function, space, image comprehensive upgrade."
But visually, we capture and transform a lot of the old store experience to present a new look in this space.
Yes! She is still the familiar first fair
But a full upgrade!
That's all we can do for our clients who love her.
初皙咖啡 店铺设计 咖啡店设计
20210504开业的初皙咖啡二店
由火山木南设计完成的全新空间
其实最不喜欢用风格来限定设计
所以只想说这是适合初皙的空间。
空间、色彩和灯光
都是为了呈现这个温暖的贴心的社区店。
常去初皙的朋友
来到新店一定能感觉到
新店是老店“功能、空间、形象全面的升级。”
但视觉上的感受，我们捕捉转化了很多老店的体验，以一种新的面貌 在这个空间呈现。
【是的！她还是那个熟悉的初皙
但是全面的升级了！
我们为初皙和中意她的客户们做的仅此而已】
